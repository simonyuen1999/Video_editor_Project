- **Responsive Design**: Modal adapts to various screen sizes and orientations

### **Technical Implementation**

**Modal Structure:**
```html
<div id="mediaModal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <span class="close">&times;</span>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <div class="media-container">
                <!-- Dynamic image/video content -->
            </div>
            <div class="metadata-panel">
                <!-- Comprehensive file information -->

**Design Rationale:** Modal viewer provides immersive media experience while maintaining context of current browsing session. System integration enables seamless workflow between web interface and desktop applications.

## 6. DATABASE ARCHITECTURE & PERFORMANCE

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete

### **SQLite Schema Design**

**Primary Media Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE media_files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER,
    creation_time TEXT,
    latitude REAL,
    longitude REAL,
    city TEXT,
    city_zh TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    country_zh TEXT,
    people_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    activity_type TEXT,
    has_talking BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Indexing Strategy:**
- **Geographic Queries**: Index on latitude/longitude for spatial operations
- **Temporal Queries**: Index on creation_time for date range filtering
- **Location Filtering**: Index on city and country for dropdown performance
- **Semantic Filtering**: Index on people_count and activity_type

### **API Performance Optimizations**

**Query Optimization:**
- **Prepared Statements**: SQLAlchemy ORM with query optimization
- **Pagination Support**: Limit/offset for large datasets
- **Selective Field Loading**: Only load required columns for specific operations
- **Statistical Caching**: Pre-computed stats for dashboard display

**Design Rationale:** SQLite provides excellent performance for desktop applications while maintaining simplicity. Proper indexing ensures responsive user interface even with large media collections.

**Rationale:** A well-defined database schema is fundamental for data integrity and efficient querying. Including these geo-specific fields directly in the database allows for powerful filtering, sorting, and organization of media based on location.

## 6. METADATA SHARING

**Problem Description:** The program does not effectively share geo-information from `.heic` or other image files with associated MP4 files in the SQLite database.

**Proposed Solution:**

Implement a metadata sharing mechanism where geo-information extracted from images (especially `.heic` files) can be propagated to MP4 files that are determined to be taken at the same location and time, or are otherwise related.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Correlation Logic:** Develop a heuristic to correlate image and video files. This could involve:
    *   **Timestamp Proximity:** If an MP4 file was recorded within a certain time window (e.g., 5 minutes) of an image being taken, and they are in the same directory, they might be related.
    *   **Filename Patterns:** Look for common naming conventions (e.g., `IMG_XXXX.HEIC` and `VID_XXXX.MP4`).
    *   **GPS Proximity:** If both have GPS data, check if their coordinates are very close.
*   **Propagation:** Once a correlation is established, the detailed geo-information (City, Region, etc.) extracted from the image will be used to update the corresponding MP4 entry in the database.
*   **ExifTool for Writing (Optional but Recommended):** For consistency, consider using `ExifTool` to *write* the extracted geo-metadata directly into the MP4 file's XMP tags, in addition to updating the database. This ensures the metadata is embedded in the file itself.

**Rationale:** Sharing metadata across related media files enhances the richness of the data for all assets. It addresses cases where videos might lack detailed geo-tags but can infer them from nearby images, leading to a more complete and searchable media collection.
