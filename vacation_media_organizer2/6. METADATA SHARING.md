`.

2.  **Data Population:** (Covered by Geo.list Integration tests) Ensure that when geo-data is available, these fields are correctly populated.

## 6. METADATA SHARING

**Problem:** Geo-information from `.heic` or other image files was not shared with MP4 files.

**Fix Implemented:** The `main.py` includes a placeholder for post-processing logic to correlate and propagate geo-data between related media files. The `MediaOrganizerDB` now has methods like `get_files_without_geo` and `get_media_by_time_and_location` to support this.

**Test Cases:**

1.  **Image-to-Video Geo Propagation (Conceptual):**
    *   **Setup:** Create a scenario where an MP4 video file is taken at roughly the same time and location as a `.heic` image file. The `.heic` file should have embedded GPS data, while the MP4 might not have detailed geo-tags (City, Region, etc.).
    *   **Execution:** Run `python3 main.py <test_directory>`.
    *   **Validation:** After processing, check the database entries for both the `.heic` and the MP4 file. The MP4 file's `city`, `region`, `subregion`, `country_code`, and `country` fields should be populated, ideally matching the data from the `.heic` file. (Note: The current implementation has a simulated `get_geo_from_coordinates` and a placeholder for the sharing logic, so this test will validate the *framework* for sharing, not necessarily the full end-to-end propagation with real-world data without further development of the correlation logic).

## Additional Improvements

Beyond these fixes, several areas could be improved:

*   **Robust `geo.list` Parsing:** Implement actual parsing of `geo.list` (e.g., CSV, JSON) and a spatial lookup algorithm (e.g., k-d tree or R-tree for nearest neighbor search) instead of the simulated `get_geo_from_coordinates`.
*   **ExifTool Wrapper:** Integrate a proper Python wrapper for ExifTool (e.g., `PyExifTool`) to avoid direct `subprocess` calls and handle parsing ExifTool output more robustly.
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling and reporting for file processing and database operations.
*   **Configuration File:** Introduce a configuration file (e.g., `config.ini`, `config.json`) for persistent settings like database path, default scan directory, and `geo.list` path.
*   **Progress Reporting:** Implement a progress bar or more detailed status updates for long-running scans.
*   **Duplicate Detection:** Add logic to detect and handle duplicate media files (e.g., based on hash or content).
*   **Web Interface:** Develop a simple web interface for browsing and searching the organized media.
*   **Cloud Integration:** Add support for cloud storage services (e.g., Google Photos, Dropbox) for backup or synchronization.
*   **Advanced Metadata Sharing:** Refine the correlation logic for metadata sharing, potentially using machine learning for more intelligent grouping of related media.
